When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I have to work on different computers, or when I'm working with different people on the same project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because sometimes we will need to keep working on an older version.
