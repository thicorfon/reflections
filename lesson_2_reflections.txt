What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git creates an empty repository and doesn't make any commits. We need to initialize a repository so we can start making commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is different because it still can be changed before you make a commit.
